# Merge Sort Algorithm in C++

This code implements the Merge Sort algorithm in C++, which uses the "divide and conquer" technique to recursively break down a given array or list into smaller sub-arrays and then merge them back together in sorted order. 

## Input

The code takes an array of doubles as input and sorts it using the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Output

The sorted array is then printed to the console.

## Functions

The code defines two functions - `merge()` and `mergeSort()` - which handle the merging and sorting operations, respectively. 

The `merge()` function merges two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array, while the `mergeSort()` function recursively divides the array into smaller sub-arrays and calls the `merge()` function to merge them back together in sorted order.
